		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">

			This class represents an abstraction of the WebXR Device API and is internally used by [page:WebGLRenderer].
			[name] also provides a public interface that allows users to enable/disable XR and perform XR related tasks like
			for instance retrieving controllers.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Boolean enabled]</h3>
		<p>
		This flag notifies the renderer to be ready for XR rendering. Default is *false*. Set it to *true* if you are going
		to use XR in your app.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isPresenting]</h3>
		<p>
		Whether XR presentation is active or not. Default is *false*. This flag is read-only and automatically set by [name].
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[method:Group getController]( [param:Integer index] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Integer index] — The index of the controller. <br /><br />

		Returns a [page:Group] representing the so called *target ray* space of the controller.
		Use this space for visualizing 3D objects that support the user in pointing tasks like UI interaction.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Group getControllerGrip]( [param:Integer index] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Integer index] — The index of the controller. <br /><br />

		Returns a [page:Group] representing the so called *grip* space of the controller.
		Use this space if the user is going to hold other 3D objects like a lightsaber.
		</p>

		<p>
		Note: If you want to show something in the user's hand AND offer a pointing ray at the same time, you'll want to attached the handheld object to the
		group returned by [page:.getControllerGrip]()  and the ray to the group returned by [page:.getController](). The idea is to have two different groups
		in two different coordinate spaces for the same WebXR controller.
